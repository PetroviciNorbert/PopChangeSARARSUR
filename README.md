<p style="margin: 0in; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0in;"><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;'>The purpose of the research is to classify the dynamics of periurbanization based on the dominant economic activities in the core cities.&nbsp;</span><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;'>We seek to move away from city-cantered approaches in urban studies without succumbing however to the lure of the recent paradigm of &ldquo;planetarization&rdquo;. Instead, we see the economic activity in core cities and the dynamics of the labour force as key elements in the periurban transformations. We understand these transformations as an example of &ldquo;exploded urbanism&rdquo; &ndash; a form in which urban features fly like shrapnel from the urban core that generate sui generis effects. In doing so, we re-conceptualize periurbanization away from the urban-rural continuum towards a scalar understanding according to which periurbanization describes a form of uneven development that emerges as an outcome of the ways in which hierarchically structured relations of capital accumulation and investment are spatialized in different locales.</span></p>
